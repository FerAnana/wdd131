        <h2>Something about me</h2>
        <p>
          <img src="images/fernando-anana.jpg" alt="Photo of Fernando Añaña" />
          I'm a 22 years old man frmo Uruguay. I'm also member of The Church of
          Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I served a mission for the Churh
          where I learn to work in a team, I also learn hablities in an office
          environment because I was also asigned to be the secretary to the
          mission president. I always was a good student and fast learner. I
          have a big capacity of adaptation to situations and environments that
          are complex or difficults for others. During my time in Chile as a
          missionary I had to moved from one city to another, some in rural
          parts of Chili and other in a metropolitan area, where I learned to
          talk to both, people from the cities and from the little towns. In
          overall, lived many experiences that made me hard and team working
          man.
